BINARY CLASSIFICATION METRICS DEFINITIONS:
- Precision: Of all instances predicted as positive, how many were actually positive?
  Important for minimizing false positives (wrongly marking negative as positive)

- Recall (Sensitivity): Of all actual positive instances, how many were correctly identified?
  Important for minimizing false negatives (missing actual positive cases)

- F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
  Useful when you need balance between precision and recall

- True Positive (TP): Correctly predicted positive
- True Negative (TN): Correctly predicted negative
- False Positive (FP): Incorrectly predicted positive (Type I error)
- False Negative (FN): Incorrectly predicted negative (Type II error)

BINARY CLASSIFICATION RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Excellent binary classification performance (>85% accuracy)
- Model is ready for production use
- Class imbalance detected: positive performs better than negative
- Consider collecting more negative samples or adjusting class weights
