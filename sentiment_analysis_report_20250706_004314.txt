CLASSIFICATION METRICS DEFINITIONS:
- Precision: Of all instances predicted as positive for a class, how many were actually positive?
  Formula: True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
  Higher precision means fewer false positive errors.

- Recall (Sensitivity): Of all actual positive instances for a class, how many were correctly identified?
  Formula: True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
  Higher recall means fewer false negative errors.

- F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics.
  Formula: 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
  F1-score is useful when you need a balance between precision and recall.

- Support: The number of actual occurrences of each class in the test dataset.
  This shows how many samples of each class were used for evaluation.
