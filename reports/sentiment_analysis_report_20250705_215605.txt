MODEL PERFORMANCE:
- Training accuracy: 0.7267
- Test accuracy: 0.6418
- Cross-validation mean: 0.7635 (+/- 0.2554)

CLASSIFICATION METRICS DEFINITIONS:
- Precision: Of all instances predicted as positive for a class, how many were actually positive?
  Formula: True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
  Higher precision means fewer false positive errors.

- Recall (Sensitivity): Of all actual positive instances for a class, how many were correctly identified?
  Formula: True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
  Higher recall means fewer false negative errors.

- F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics.
  Formula: 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
  F1-score is useful when you need a balance between precision and recall.

- Support: The number of actual occurrences of each class in the test dataset.
  This shows how many samples of each class were used for evaluation.

MACRO AVERAGE (unweighted mean across all classes):
  Precision: 0.6791 (67.91%)
  Recall: 0.7032 (70.32%)
  F1-score: 0.5857 (58.57%)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Model performance is acceptable (60-70% accuracy)
- Consider collecting more training data
- Try different preprocessing techniques
